# Sentiment Analysis Dashboard – Business Analytics Internship

## Overview
This Power BI project was developed during my internship as a **Business Analytics Intern at Coreline Solutions Inc. (Remote)** between **June 2025 and July 2025**.

The dashboard analyses customer review data to understand **sentiment patterns, key drivers of sentiment, rating behaviour, and theme-level performance**.  
It supports data-driven decision-making by identifying areas impacting customer experience, service quality, and delivery performance.
